4 - Horizontal velocity sensor
- derivative of horizonal position

5 - Vertical velocity sensor
- derivative of vertical position

6 - Horizontal position sensor
- integral of horizonatal velocity

7 - Vertical position sensor
- integral of vertical velocity

8 - Angle sensor
- if possible, take average ~ 60 samples (on 0 mean observation)

9 - Sonar
-rotate sector 3-6 to keep laser pointed down to be used for safety and
sector 7-0 to help left and right saftey

---position and velocity sensors fail (both x or both y)---
- need to figure out when we are above the platform
- we have last good reading (last known position and velocity)
- have last known platdx or playdy (know whether we need to go left or right)
- cannot use velocity limit (may cause crashes left and right)

- last known velocity + integral of acceleration to derive velocity over s seconds
- since we now have velocity, we can use the case when the position sensor fails
